        In certain fancy restaurants, you&apos;ll see “gastrique” or “agrodolce” on the menu, which are just other ways to say “sweet and sour.” All are a viscous sauce made with a sugar (sucrose most of the time, but you can also use honey, agave, or anything else sweet) that can carry an acid, like a vinegar. As you reduce the sugar, you concentrate its sweetness until it is a perfect balance to the abrasiveness of vinegar. They bring out the best in each other. However you come at it, sweet and sour is most delicious when you get that first bite of crispiness followed by a hit of tangy, mouthwatering sweetness. To make that crispiness last, you need a batter built from three starches. Short-grain glutinous rice flour (such as mochiko) makes the batter stick, while water-milled, long-grain glutinous rice flour (look for “水磨糯米粉” on the label) holds the crunch. Cornstarch walls in the juices from the chicken as it cooks. For the glaze, instead of straight sugar, this recipe calls for orange juice cooked down for a couple hours with some honey, brown rice syrup, and Shaoxing. “d Shaoxing. There&apos;s a little tingle and kick, too, from garlic, ginger, and chile. I kept these as wings, not nuggets, for that extra flavor, as the Chinese say, that comes from eating the meat closest to the bone, right off the bone. The wings will be double-fried, first in a dry dredge and then a wet batter, so plan to dredge and fry in batches.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To make the wings: Cut the wings at both joints. Keep the drumettes and flats; discard the wing tips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fit a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. In a large saucepan over high heat, combine the water, salt, sugar, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and star anise and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar. Strain this brine into the prepared bowl and discard the solids. Let cool to room temperature and then add the chicken wings, making sure they are submerged. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the sauce: In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the vinegar, wine, orange juice, brown rice syrup, honey, ginger, garlic, and chiles and simmer until reduced to the consistency and color of warm molasses, about 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the sauce is reduced, fit a fine-mesh strainer over a small bowl. Strain the sauce, discard the solids, and let cool. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the vinaigrette: Set a medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the orange slices and sear until charred, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the slices to a cutting board, let cool, and then mince. Transfer to a small bowl. Add the vinegar, orange juice, neutral oil, fennel seeds, and salt and whisk together. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Re-whisk before using.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 200°F. Fit two wire roasting racks over two rimmed baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill a wok or Dutch oven with the neutral oil and secure a deep-fry thermometer on the side. Set over medium-high heat and warm the oil to 375°F, being careful to maintain this temperature as you fry. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together both glutinous flours and the cornstarch. Drain the wings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss about one-third of the wings in the flour mixture. Transfer to a colander and shake off the excess flour back into the bowl. Place the wings in the oil and fry, stirring occasionally, to set the coating, 3 to 4 minutes “(they will not be cooked through or look browned yet). Transfer to a prepared rack. Repeat with the remaining wings in two more batches.
        </li>
        <li>
            Measure 1⅔ cups / 200g of the flour mixture into a large bowl and discard the rest. Add the water, wok salt, and fennel fronds and whisk until a smooth, thin batter forms.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss about one-third of the wings in the batter. Pick them out of the batter one at a time, allowing excess batter to drain into the bowl, then slide into the oil and fry until light golden brown, crisp, and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to the second prepared rack and keep warm in the oven as you fry the rest. Whisk the batter between each batch. Rewarm the orange sauce over low heat while the last batch is frying.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the wings in a large bowl, drizzle with the orange sauce, and toss to coat. (Toss in batches if your bowl isn&apos;t big enough for the wings to really move.)</li>
        <li>
            Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with the green onion and jalapeño. Dress the shaved fennel with ⅓ cup / 80ml
