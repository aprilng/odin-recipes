    <h1>Squid Ink Wontons</h1>

        You can watch the wontons through the window at Hon&apos;s Wun-Tun House on Kearny Street, floating up like clouds from the depths of a huge pot of boiling water. Wontons are easy to make, but there are nuances known only to those who have made thousands. The cooks at Hon&apos;s fold them with one pinch—signed, sealed, delivered and then on to the next in a flash. It takes time to build that muscle memory; but once you get into a rhythm, it&apos;s meditative. When my mom wanted a heart-to-heart, she&apos;d call me into the kitchen to wrap wontons. We&apos;d talk about school or my ninety-nine problems, while I was distracted by the task of getting our wontons to look like birds with scissor tails. Whatever form you make them, aim for a 30/70 ratio of filling to silky skin. This recipe draws from the Sichuan (pork with chile) and Guangdong (shrimp with green onions) styles, and the squid-ink mezzaluna stuffed with guanciale that I loved in Italy. You can often find squid ink—technically, it&apos;s from cuttlefish—frozen or jarred in Asian and Mediterranean grocery stores.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To make the wrappers: In a small bowl, stir together the boiling water and squid ink. Place the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour in the diluted ink and mix until a smooth dough forms a ball around the hook, about 5 minutes, adding more water a tiny bit at a time if it needs help coming together. If mixing by hand, drizzle the diluted ink into the flour while stirring with a fork or your fingers. Using your hands, knead to incorporate all the flour into the dough, adding a little more water at a time, if required. Knead the dough on a clean work surface until smooth, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Form the dough into a ball by tucking the sides of the dough under itself, turning the ball as you go. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
        Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            The dough should now look smooth; divide it into three pieces. Roll one piece of the dough at a time (keep the rest covered with a damp kitchen towel) through the pasta roller, starting at the thickest setting and moving down incrementally until slightly less than 1/16 inch thick (setting 5 on a KitchenAid pasta roller). Roll the dough through twice on this final setting. If the dough gets too long to handle, cut it in half before continuing to roll. You can also use a rolling pin to make scant-1/16-inch-thick sheets (no need to flour).
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a knife or pizza cutter, trim and cut the dough sheets into 2½-inch squares. Arrange the squares on the prepared baking sheet so none is touching, layering parchment paper between the squares and covering with damp kitchen towels, until you have thirty wrappers. Leave covered and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 3 hours.
        </li>
		<li>
            To make the filling: Using a meat grinder, pass the pork belly through a coarse grinding plate (¼-inch / 6mm holes) into the bowl of a stand mixer. Repeat with the shrimp. Add the egg, chives, soy sauce, garlic, and cayenne to the bowl. Set the bowl in the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium-low speed into a sticky paste (don&apos;t worry too much about overworking), about 1 minute.
        </li>
		<li>
            Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Uncover six of the wrappers (keep the rest under the towel while working). Spoon about 1½ tsp filling in the center of a wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half to form a triangle and seal, pressing hard enough that the edges thin slightly. Holding the stuffed triangle flat, pull the two lower corners to meet and overlap slightly (there should be some tension so that the stuffed part pooches), and press together, forming a wonton in the shape of a little swallow. (I find it easier to seal just the top of the triangle, then join the two lower corners, before sealing the entire edge.) Repeat until all the filling is used up. If at any point the wrappers start to dry out and stop sealing when pinched together, trace the edges of the wrapper with a water-dampened finger. (If not cooking right away, refrigerate the wontons on the baking sheet, covered with a damp kitchen towel, for up to 3 hours. You can also freeze them solid, uncovered, on the baking sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag and store in the freezer for up to 2 months. Cook from frozen; do not thaw first.)
        </li>

            To make the vinegar: In a small bowl, whisk together the chile oil, vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil until combined. Set aside.
        </li>
		<li>
            Bring a large saucepan of heavily salted water (it should remind you of seawater) to a boil over high heat. Add the wontons and boil until cooked through, 3 minutes if fresh, or 4 minutes if frozen.
        </li>
		<li>
            Meanwhile, warm a large frying pan or wok over high heat. Add the neutral oil and let it heat up for a few seconds. Add the squid and green onions and then don&apos;t touch until they char in spots, about 30 seconds. Stir-fry until the squid is just cooked through, about 30 seconds more. Remove from the heat and toss with the chile paste.
        </li>
		<li>
            When the wontons are ready, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a large bowl. Toss with ⅓ cup of the wonton vinegar. Transfer to a serving dish and top with the squid and micro-celery, if desired. Serve with the remaining wonton vinegar for dipping.
